AUM-Ternary-Logic-Gates Repository

📖 Overview
This repository contains the manuscript, truth tables, and simulation data for the paper:

“Design and Behavioural Simulation of AUM-Based Ternary Logic Gates for Multi-Valued Digital Systems”
Authors: Diptanu Dey, Raj Chakraborty, Punam Das, Diptanu Das, and Kamanasish Bhattacharjee

The work presents the design, simulation, and analysis of AUM-based ternary logic gates (NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) that extend conventional binary logic into a balanced ternary domain.
📂 Repository Contents
- /manuscript/ → The full manuscript in .docx and .pdf formats
- /truth_tables/ → Corrected AUM truth tables (Markdown + Word format)
- /simulations/ → Simulation results for all AUM gates (figures/plots)
- /src/ → Source files (e.g., SPICE, Verilog, or behavioral models if available)
- /data/ → Raw and processed datasets used for figures
⚡ Features
- Novel AUM-based balanced ternary logic framework
- Simulation of seven fundamental gates using voltage mapping (0 V, 1.65 V, 3.3 V)
- Comparison with binary logic in terms of expressiveness & complexity
- Provides truth tables, figures, and circuit behavior
🚀 Usage
1. Explore /truth_tables/ for reference truth tables of AUM logic gates.
2. See /simulations/ for circuit behavior plots.
3. If you want to replicate simulations:
   - Open files in /src/ with your preferred simulator (SPICE, Verilog, etc.)
   - Use voltage mapping:
     • A = 3.3 V
     • U = 1.65 V
     • M = 0 V
